# Render

This directory contains all files necessary for rendering. One example scene is included for demonstration. This is implemented by Luigi Liu (yl366).

- **mitsuba_gallery/**  
  Assets and scene configuration files.

- **render_script/**  
  Rendering scripts. You may either run `run.sh` to execute the full pipeline or run individual scene scripts (e.g., `classroom.py`).

- **classroom/**  
  Rendered outputs for the example scene.
