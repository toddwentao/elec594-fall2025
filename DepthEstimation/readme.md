# Depth Estimation

This directory implements a method that uses the moving distance of tracking points to estimate the depth map. This is implemented by Luigi Liu (yl366).

- **co-tracker/**
    Original co-tracker repository resoures.

- **track_point.py**
    To track a grid of points on images.

- **generate_depth_map.py**
    To recover the depth map from the motion trajectories of the tracking points.
